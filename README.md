# Object Follower

This project aims to make the robot follow a particular object while also keeping a minimum safe distance from it. We have also implemented a proportional controller for the linear velocity of the bot. 

The software stacks implemented in this project are ROS and Python. We also made use of OpenCV for the object detection part.

We aim to further expand this project and make it a person-follower.
